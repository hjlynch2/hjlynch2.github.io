        This project was a product of the CS 196 class at UIUC, where students form
        teams with other students in order to develop an idea presented at the beginning
        of the semester. Our team's goal for this project was to become acclimated to
        web development because all of us had no experience in web developent. The original
        idea called for a web application that allowed users to post events that are
        happening locally, similar to Yik Yak.
